Static Web Gallery

This project is unfinished and not maintained any longer. 
It may serve as an example of how to build a database application with GUI in scala and SWT.

After struggling with this project I have done it differently:
* I reimplemented it in (quick and dirty) python code instead of scala,
* relational database was replaced by plain json files and
* SWT GUI was replaced by a web-based GUI on bottle.py.
Lesson learned - some tasks can be done 10x faster with appropriate tools :-)
I still love scala, relational databases and respect SWT - just no more killing flies with a hammer.
